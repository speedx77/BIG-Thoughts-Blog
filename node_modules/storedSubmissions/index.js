Although we are micro moments in an infinite continuum, our actions, even the small ones, have rippling effects on history. Time is a never-ending stream and we are the tributaries of it, contributing our wealth of stories and decisions to a grander tale that we have the pleasure of being featured in. Throughout high school you will be faced with a variety of choices ranging from academic to life decisions. Many will not seem important at all- but I promise they are. What you chose to do is ultimately dependent upon you, but there is a key word at the quintessence of every decision- a word called sacrifice.\nWe make them all the time- for ourselves, for those whom we love, and even for those who we feel indifferent yet hope towards. We all have our own definition of the word. I use to think that sacrifice could be about letting go a certain lifestyle, leaving behind gifts and abilities to achieve something greater for myself in order to prove my ideals to the world. That belief was wrong.",
